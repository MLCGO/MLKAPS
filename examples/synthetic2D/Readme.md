# Synthetic 2D Example

## Prerequisites

Before running this example, ensure you have `mlkaps` installed. Follow the installation guidelines provided in the main [README](../../README.md).

## Running the Test

This test demonstrates usage of `mlkaps` framework on a synthetic 2D dataset. To run the test, simply execute the following command:

```bash
mlkaps ga-adaptive.json
```

This command will use the `ga-adaptive.json` configuration file to perform the test.

You can explore the different outputs in `./mlkaps_output`.
